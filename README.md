scribble
========

a scribble-around-your-mouse kind of thing.

Random scribble within the bounds of a diamond that follows your mouse. The size of the diamond is default 40px
top point to bottom point. The size is increases with the speed of your mouse movement. Doesn't seem to be 
working very well in safari, but chrome works fine.
